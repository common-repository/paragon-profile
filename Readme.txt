== Purpose ==

This plugin was created to solve issues with login, registration, contact page for simple websites, if you want users to register and use your website, you may want the registration process to be hassle free. I designed a plugin that helps users to resell SMS via wordpress but how do they get users to register on their wordpress site and use the services? This plugin is the answer to that question.
